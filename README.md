# Node http server intro

## Documentation of the Code

All files have inline documentation in comments.

`index.js` is the starting point for reading about the code. View it next to get started. That file is commented with details about each line and function.

`appConfig.js` is a very basic intro to having configuration information in a file.  Configuration is used in `git`, `npm` and even our custom configuration for any app we build such as this one where the server hostname can be expected to change between develpment and a pulic hosting setup.


`app.js` contains our app functions.
